A queue is a linear list of elements in which deletions can take place only at one end called the front, and
insertions can take place only at the end called the rear. The queue is a First In First Out type of data structure (FIFO), 
the terms FRONT and REAR are used in describing a linear list only when it is implemented as a queue.

Example:
queue<int> q;
queue<string> q;

Functions:
1. push() – to insert an element in the queue.
   queue<int> q
   q.push(110);
   q.push(220);
2. pop() – deletes the first element of the queue.
   q.pop();
3. front() – returns a reference to the first element of the queue.
   q.front();
4. back() – returns a reference to the last element of the queue.
   q.back();
5. emplace() – to insert an element in the queue.
   queue<int> q;
   q.emplace(1);
   q.emplace(2);
6. size() – returns the number of elements on the queue.
   q.size();
7. empty() – to check if the queue is empty or not.
   q.empty();
