In the case of the max heap, priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that its first element 
is always the greatest of the elements it contains and the rest elements are in decreasing order.

In the case of the min heap, priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that its first element 
is always the smallest of the elements it contains and the rest elements are in increasing order.

Note: In C++ STL by default max-heap is created.

Example:
priority_queue<int> pq;

The syntax for a min-heap priority queue
priority_queue<object_type,vector<object_type>,greater<object_type>> variable_name;
Example:
priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> pq;

Functions :
1.push() – to insert an element in the priority queue.
  pq.push(110);
  pq.push(220);
2.pop() – deletes the top element of the priority queue.
  pq.pop();
3.top() – returns the element at the top of the priority queue.
  pq.top();
4.emplace() – to insert an element in the priority.
  pq.emplace(1);
  pq.emplace(2);
5.size() – returns the number of elements in the priority queue.
  pq.size();
6.empty() – to check if the priority queue is empty or not.
pq.empty();
