A list in STL is a contiguous container that allows the inserting and erasing of elements in constant time and iterating in both directions.

Example:
list<int> li;
list<string> li;

Functions:
1.push_back() – to insert an element at the end of the list.
list<int> li;
li.push_back(110);
li.push_back(220);
2.push_front() – to insert an element at the front of the list.
list<int> li;
li.push_front(110);
li.push_front(220);
3.pop_back() – deletes the last element of the list.
li.pop_back();
4.pop_front() – deletes the front element of the list.
li.pop_front();
5.front() – it gives a reference to the first element of the list.
li.front();
6.back() – it gives a reference to the last element of the list.
li.back();
7.reverse() – reverse the list.
li.reverse();
8.sort() – sorts the list in ascending order.
li.sort();
9.size() – returns the number of elements on the list.
li.size();
10.empty() – to check if the list is empty or not.
li.empty();
11.begin() – it refers to the first element of the list.
12.end() – it refers to the theoretical element after the last element of the list.
13.cbegin() – it refers to the first element of the list.
14.cend() – it refers to the theoretical element after the last element of the list.
15.rbegin() – it points to the last element of the list.
16.rend() – it points to the theoretical element before the first element of the list.
17.emplace_front() – to insert an element at the front of the list.
18.emplace_back() – to insert an element at the end of the list.
19.max_size() – the maximum elements a list can hold.
20.clear() – to delete all the elements of the list.
21.erase() – to delete a single element or elements between a particular range.
