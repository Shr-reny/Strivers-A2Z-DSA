Double Ended Queue which is also called Deque is a type of queue data structure in which the insertion and deletion of elements can be either
in front or rear. 

Example:
deque<int> dq;
deque<string> dq;

Functions :

1. push_back() – to insert an element at the end of the deque.
   deque<int> dq;
   dq.push_back(110);
   dq.push_back(220);
2. push_front() – to insert an element at the front of the deque.
   deque<int> dq;
   dq.push_front(110);
   dq.push_front(220);
3. pop_back() – deletes the last element of the deque.
   dq.pop_back();
4. pop_front() – deletes the front element of the deque.
   dq.pop_front();
5. front() – it gives a reference to the first element of the deque.
   dq.front();
6. back() – it gives a reference to the last element of the deque.
   dq.back();
7. size() – returns the number of elements on the deque.
   dq.size();
8. empty() – to check if the deque is empty or not.
   dq.empty();
